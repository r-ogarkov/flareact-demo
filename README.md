# Flareact Demo

Get started with Flareact by installing [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler)

Next, fill in `account_id` and `name` inside your `wrangler.toml` file.

Add `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` to `.env` file.

Finally, run `yarn dev` to see magic happen 🎉

Go edit a page in your `/pages` directory to get started 👍
